# Speedshard - Sprint

## Description

This mod increases the number of tiles travelled each turn while not being in combat. That way, buffs can last longer while travelling huge distances.

Other functionalities can be found in [Speedshard_Core](https://github.com/remyCases/SpeedshardCore), [Speedshard_Backpack](https://github.com/remyCases/SpeedshardBackpack), [Speedshard_Skinning](https://github.com/remyCases/SpeedshardSkinning), [Speedshard_MoneyDungeon](https://github.com/remyCases/SpeedshardMoneyDungeon) and [Speedshard_Stances](https://github.com/remyCases/SpeedshardStances).

## Installation

Since this mod was made through MSL, you first need to install it and then patching the game with it.
You can follow the official [installation guide](https://dddddragon.github.io/ModShardLauncher/guides/how-to-play-mod.html) on the MSL documentation.

A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J0oJYGi38E&t=13s&ab_channel=Nylux) was made by Nylux to show how to install Neoconsole, if you prefer a video guide.

### Installing MSL

- Download the latest release of [MSL](https://github.com/DDDDDragon/ModShardLauncher).
- Unzip it.
- **Move the `ModShard.dll` file to your Stoneshard folder.**
- (Optional) Rename the data.win file in the Stoneshard folder with an other name so you'll have a backup if something went wrong.

### Using MSL

- Download the latest `.sml` file released of [Speedshard - Sprint](https://github.com/remyCases/SpeedshardSprint/releases).
- Move the `Speedshard_Sprint.sml` in the `MSL/Mods` folder.
- Run `ModShardLauncher.exe`.
- Click on the anvil icon on the leftside.
- Click on the folder icon on the topside. A dialog box should pop up.
- Select the `.win` file in the Stoneshard folder (`data.win` if you didn't rename it).
- Enable the mod by checking the `Enable` box.
- Click the floppy disk icon on the topside. A dialog box should pop up.
- In this dialog box, create a new `.win` file and save (`data.win` if you didn't rename it).
- Move the `speedshard_sprint.ini` file in the Stoneshard folder.

You can now play the game with the modded version !

## Troubleshooting

If you encountered some troubles while trying to patch your game, first check if you **move the `ModShard.dll`** in the Stoneshard folder.

Then you can contact me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/200330865522376704), and send me the latest log file found in `MSL/logs`.
